KNN imputation makes sure the similarity between samples to estimate missing values based on the patterns in the other features, and the results are rounded and clipped to ensure only valid integer ratings (1-5) are used. This approach avoids introducing nonsensical decimal values and is more robust than median or mode imputation when a large portion of the data is missing.\n",
