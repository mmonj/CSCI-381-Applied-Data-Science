1.  Extract the numbers
2.  Extract the names
3.  Rearrange the vector so that all elements conform to the standard “firstname lastname”, preserving any titles (e.g., “Rev.”, “Dr.”, etc) or middle/second names.
4.  Construct a logical vector indicating whether a character has a title (i.e., Rev. and Dr.)
5.  Construct a logical vector indicating whether a character has a middle/second name.
6.  Consider the HTML string <title>+++BREAKING NEWS+++<title>. We would like to extract the first HTML tag (i.e., “<title>”). To do so we write the regular expression “<.+>”. Explain why this fails and correct the expression.
7.  Consider the string “(5-3)^2=5^2-2\*5\*3+3^2”. We would like to extract the equation in its entirety from the string. To do so we write the regular expression “\[^0-9=+\*()\]+”. Explain why this fails and correct the expression.
